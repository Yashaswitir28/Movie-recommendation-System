# MOCO: Movie Recommendation System

# Overview

MOCO is an AI-ML-based movie recommendation system that primarily uses collaborative filtering techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The project was developed as part of the Machine Intelligence Course (UE20CS302).

# Introduction

MOCO (short for MOVIe COllaborative) is designed to recommend movies based on user preferences and historical ratings using collaborative filtering techniques. The system aims to provide accurate and personalized movie suggestions.

# Features:

Utilizes KNN, SVD, and User-Based Collaborative Filtering techniques.

Provides personalized recommendations based on user input.

Includes an evaluation mechanism to refine recommendation accuracy.

Prerequisites & Tech Stack

# Language:

Python

# Tools & Libraries:

Tools: Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook

Python Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, Datetime, Re, Sklearn, Ipywidgets, IPython, Surprise

# Installation & Execution Steps

Follow these steps to set up and run MOCO:

- Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/Yashaswitir28/Movie-recommendation-System.git

- Launch Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda.

- Navigate to the MOCO Directory:

cd Movie-Recommendation-System-MOCO
cd MOCO

- Open and Run the Notebook:

- Open MOCO.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

- Run all cells using "Restart & Run All" from the Kernel menu.

# MOCO uses three collaborative filtering models:

- Model 1: User-Based Collaborative Filtering

- Model 2: KNN-Based Collaborative Filtering

- Model 3: SVD-Based Collaborative Filtering


# Usage

MOCO provides tailored movie recommendations using collaborative filtering techniques. It allows users to:

Receive personalized movie suggestions.

Evaluate and refine recommendations for better accuracy.

Utilize the system for AI-ML coursework, including Machine Intelligence projects.

MOCO can serve as a foundation for developing more advanced recommendation systems.

# Conclusion

Thank you for exploring MOCO! We hope you enjoy discovering and evaluating new movies. üçøüé¨
